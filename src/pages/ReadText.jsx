                            The error you’re seeing indicates that the style prop in your React component is being passed as a string, but React expects it to be an object. To fix this issue, you'll need to ensure that you’re passing an object to the style prop, not a string.
                            What’s Causing the Error?
                            React's style prop expects a JavaScript object where the keys are camelCased CSS properties and the values are the corresponding styles. If you accidentally pass a string (as you might in traditional HTML/CSS), React will throw this error.
